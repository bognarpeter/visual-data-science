The application is an interactive dashboard, which aims to enable an easy and agile way to analyze water quality data of waters of San Francisco and its surroundings.
It is written in Python using the Bokeh library and can be used in any browser.

## Data
We used the publicly available sensor-data of USGS:
[Bay Area Water Data](https://sfbay.wr.usgs.gov/access/wqdata/index.html)

The data which is used by the application is pre-processed by the `sfbay-preprocessing.py` script and stored as `data/sfbay_final.csv`. The data can be regenerated by simply running the script.
